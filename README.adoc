== Purpose

This Hello World customization uses a Mqtt-to-Kafka transformer which forwards MQTT PUBLISHES to a Kafka cluster.
It maps the MQTT topic structure to a matching Kafka topic structure and preserves MQTT 5 user properties as Kafka record headers.

We strongly recommend reading the {hivemq-kafka-docs}[HiveMQ Enterprise Extension for Kafka Documentation]
to grasp the core concepts of HiveMQ Kafka customization development.

== Installation

. Clone this repository into a Java 11 gradle project.
. Run `./gradlew jar` task from gradle to build the customization.
. Move the file: "build/libs/hivemq-kafka-hello-world-customization-4.27.0.jar" to the directory: "HIVEMQ_HOME/extensions/hivemq-kafka-extension/customizations"
. Copy the resources/kafka-configuration.xml to "HIVEMQ_HOME/extensions/hivemq-kafka-extension" and adapt it to your environment.
. Delete the "HIVEMQ_HOME/extensions/hivemq-kafka-extension/DISABLED" file.
. Start HiveMQ.

== First Steps

=== Manual Testing
